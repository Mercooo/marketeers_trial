Flask Backend for MarketEers Trial
This repository contains the backend code for the MarketEers Trial project. It is built using Flask as the web framework and exposes REST APIs for frontend communication.

Project Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the backend:

1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your dependencies. Run the following commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate virtual environment (Linux/Mac)
venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate virtual environment (Windows)
3. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have pip installed and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all the required libraries for the backend, including Flask and any other necessary dependencies.

4. Setup Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of the project to define environment variables, such as database credentials and secret keys. Here is an example .env file:

env
Copy
Edit
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DATABASE_URI=your_database_uri_here
5. Run the Backend Server
To start the Flask development server, use the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
flask run
By default, the Flask app will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

You can also specify a different host and port by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=your_port
6. Test the API
Once the Flask server is running, you can test the API endpoints using Postman or cURL.

The basic API endpoints are:

Login Endpoint (POST /api/login): Accepts user credentials and returns a JWT token.

Data Endpoint (GET /api/data): A sample API to fetch data from the database.

7. JWT Authentication
To use the authentication system, you need to first log in to get a JWT token. The token will be required for accessing protected routes.

Example: Login Request
Send a POST request to /api/login with the following JSON body:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
}
If successful, the response will include a token:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "access_token": "your_jwt_token_here"
}
You can then pass this token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token for future API calls.
